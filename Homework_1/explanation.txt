first attempt i will find out which is the most common letter

I slowly went through each letter finding out which old letter corresponded to the new one. First I found i, then a, then finished
some words that had common endings with said vowels. As I continued I gradually increased the amount of letters that I knew and I
replaced the most common word dictionary with the one that solved the encryption. The process was tedious and in all took me about and hour
and a half in order to finish it all.

In order to find the user7 password I put the decryption key in reverse and tried with SHA224. I did not realize it is the SHA-3 version until much later.
Took less than a second to run.
