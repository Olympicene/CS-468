My first instinct when given this prompt was to figure out how to create a proxy. I did some research
regarding what proxies do and how they work in order to better understand what I was really creating
After finding the appropriate resources I made a basic proxy and I began to build upon that original 
design. Reading the packets going though my proxy, both ways, was my next task and that was fairly easy.
What gave me the most trouble was parsing through all the packets to find the relevant data. Passive mode
took me the longest time as creating the right regex strings to get the information that I wanted was 
quite a pain. In addition properly coding and decoding the bytestrings while not breaking anything
i previously worked on was quite stressful. However after passive mode was done I found active mode to 
be easy, since i was familiar with the inner workings of the proxy. Just adding a few hooks and injections
was rather quick because its just one step more after observing. My choice for the phishing attack was to simply
intercept the packet going to the original website, cut it off and send my own site.
