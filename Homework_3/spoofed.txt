In the on-path injection attack that we have doing in this homework the DNS responses
extremely similar to legitimate responses. The TXID, QR bit and source/dest IP 
address are copied perfectly and it is virtually impossible to tell it from a
legitimate DNS response. The only reliable way I found to detect poisoning attempts
was to compile a list of dns responses with the same TXID and see if they match.
I would check the aforementioned parameters and see if their response differed.
If they did, for example, have a no name then a real IP with the same TXID
I would know that a response was forged. This was my implementation.
